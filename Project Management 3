    <h1>Problem Statement — Reduce Student Wait Time at Campus Printing Stations</h1>

    <h2>1. Concise Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
      Students experience long, unpredictable wait times at the three main campus printing stations during peak hours,
      resulting in missed deadlines and lost study time. The current system lacks real-time queue visibility and routing suggestions.
      This project will design and prototype a low-cost digital solution to reduce average wait time by at least <strong>30%</strong> during peak hours,
      and provide accurate queue information to students.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Why it matters (Impact)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Prevents missed deadlines and reduces student stress.</li>
      <li>Improves study efficiency and fairness for students without home printers.</li>
      <li>Offers near-term, low-cost improvements with potential campus-wide benefits.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Stakeholders</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Primary:</strong> Students who use campus printing services</li>
      <li><strong>Secondary:</strong> Campus IT/Printing Services, Library staff, Student Government</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Scope</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>In scope</dt>
      <dd>Baseline data collection, prototype UI for queue visibility, basic re-routing suggestions, 10–20 user usability test.</dd>
      <dt>Out of scope</dt>
      <dd>Full campus deployment, billing/payment changes, large hardware purchases.</dd>
    </dl>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Constraints, Assumptions & Risks</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Constraints</dt>
      <dd>6-week timeline, budget \$500, limited direct access to printer queue APIs without IT sign-off.</dd>
      <dt>Assumptions</dt>
      <dd>Peak hours: Mon–Thu 10:00–13:00 and 17:00–20:00. IT will allow an API adapter later.</dd>
      <dt>Risks & mitigation</dt>
      <dd>Risk: no API access &rarr; Mitigation: sampling / voluntary check-ins & design API adapter for integration.</dd>
    </dl>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Success Criteria & Deliverables</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Measured reduction in average wait time ≥ 30% during pilot peak hours.</li>
      <li>Prototype web UI with queue estimates within ±2 minutes accuracy for 80% of samples.</li>
      <li>Usability test report showing ≥ 70% participants report time saved.</li>
      <li>Deliverables: baseline data, prototype, test report, README + deployment notes.</li>
    </ul>
